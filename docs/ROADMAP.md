# Subfolio-Astro Roadmap

A port of [Subfolio](https://github.com/ryanilano/subfolio) from **Kohana 2.x / PHP 5.6**
(both long EOL) to an **Astro static site → Cloudflare Pages, hybrid-ready**. This is a
*port* that preserves the look and content conventions, not a redesign.

The deployment decision (Go binary → Astro static) and its rationale live in
[ADR-deployment.md](./ADR-deployment.md). The behavior being ported is captured,
stack-agnostic, in [spec/](./spec/).

## What carries over vs. gets rewritten

| Carries over ~as-is | Gets rewritten |
|---|---|
| SCSS/CSS, fonts, images, SVG icons | View *logic* (PHP views → Astro components) |
| `directory/` content + all naming conventions | The Kohana engine (`Filebrowser`/`Subfolio`/`Access`) → an Astro content loader |
| YAML config (settings/filekinds/users/groups) | YAML loading (Spyc → `yaml` npm lib) |
| URL structure / routes | Auth (custom salt → Web Crypto/`scrypt`, in the deferred Worker) |

The new app reads the *same* `directory/` content, so old PHP and new Astro can run
side-by-side against identical content for diffing. No data migration.

## Phases

- **Phase 0 — Capture the spec.** ✅ **DONE** (in the upstream `subfolio` repo). Behavior
  extracted from `Filebrowser.php`/`Subfolio.php`/`FileKind.php` into the stack-agnostic
  specs now mirrored in [spec/](./spec/).
- **Phase 1 — Astro content loader (de-risk first).** ✅ **DONE.** A custom Astro loader
  walks the content directory, interprets every naming convention (`-hidden`,
  `-t-`/`-m-`/`-b-` embeds, `.link`/`.cut`/`.pop`/`.ftr`/`.slide`/`.oplx`/`.rss`,
  `-properties`/`.info` YAML, retina/shadow variants) and emits typed entries. Validated
  against the bundled `content/examples/` fixture via a throwaway `/debug` route. Deferred
  behaviors (sharp thumbnails, RSS fetch, Textile/Markdown render, `-access` enforcement)
  are captured as **parsed intent** in the entries, not yet executed.
- **Phase 2 — Themes → Astro components.** ✅ **DONE.** Ported the `default` theme's layouts,
  listing views, and per-filekind views to Astro components consuming the loader's folder
  entries, with the existing SCSS/assets. Wired them into a catch-all route
  ([src/pages/[...path].astro](../src/pages/%5B...path%5D.astro)) that resolves folder/file/
  single/slide views like the PHP controller, plus a `/directory/<path>` raw-bytes endpoint;
  dropped the `/debug` route at cutover. Deferred behaviors (sharp dimensions, RSS fetch,
  Textile/MD body rendering, `-access`) remain captured as parsed intent. See
  [spec/SPEC-theme-api.md](./spec/SPEC-theme-api.md) and [spec/SPEC-filekinds.md](./spec/SPEC-filekinds.md).
- **Phase 3 — Build pipeline & deploy.** ✅ **DONE.** `sharp` thumbnails at build
  (resize-if-stale per [spec/SPEC-thumbnails.md](./spec/SPEC-thumbnails.md)), RSS fetch at
  build, `sass`, sitemap; deploy to Cloudflare via Wrangler using the **Workers
  static-assets** pattern (`wrangler.jsonc` → `assets.directory: ./dist`, `npm run deploy`),
  mirroring the current `ilano-fyi` setup (which moved off the Pages adapter). Diff
  side-by-side against the live PHP app on the same content.
- **Phase 4 — Auth Worker (deferred / optional).** *Only if* access-gated folders become a
  real requirement: a Cloudflare Worker for login, sessions (KV), `-access` evaluation, and
  gated file serving. Web Crypto/`scrypt` for hashing. See
  [spec/SPEC-auth.md](./spec/SPEC-auth.md) and [spec/SPEC-access.md](./spec/SPEC-access.md).
  **Skipped entirely until the need is real.** Until it exists, everything served is public.
- **Phase 5 — Enhancer polish.** ✅ **DONE.** **Markdown body rendering**
  (remark/unified, replacing the deferred Textile/MD intent — `.txt` detail views + `-t-/-m-
  /-b-` text embeds; default engine switched textile→markdown, fixture content converted);
  **`.pop` popups** verified working (`A17.Helpers.pop` in the bundled JS); **`.slide`**
  fixed (the redirect now emits the first file's detail page — was 404ing — plus prev/next
  stepping and the breadcrumb "HACK FOR SLIDE" parent-link port); **`.oplx` build-time zip
  artifacts** (pre-build `scripts/gen-oplx.mjs` zips each `.oplx` folder into an out-of-tree
  cache served at `/directory/<folder>.zip`, mirroring the thumbnail-cache pattern).
